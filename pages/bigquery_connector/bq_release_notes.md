Google BigQuery Connector Release Notes
================================

The Google BigQuery connector allows you to access the Google BigQuery
REST API through Anypoint Platform.

BigQuery is a RESTful web service that enables interactive analysis of
massive datasets working in conjunction with Google Storage. The
connector exposes Google BigQuery operations by executing their API
calls as per configuration.

Read through the [User Guide](bq_user_guide.html) to understand how to set up and configure a
basic flow using the connector. Review the connector operations and see
how they work by reviewing the [API Reference document](bq_api_reference.html) alongside the demo
applications.
